Tetris game design guidelines

Playfield: 10 columns * 20 rows

Tetrominoes (shapes consisting of 4 blocks) - fall from top of playfield 1 row at a time

Each tetromino enters the playfield with a given orientation and colour depending on its shape

Part of the tetrion (game machine) is the piece preview, which shows the next pieces that will enter the playfield.

The player can rotate the falling tetromino 90 degrees at a time within the 10 * 20 playfield by pressing the counterclockwise or clockwise rotation buttons (provided the piece has room to rotate). The player can shift the falling tetromino sideways one space at a time by pressing the left or right arrow or holding it for quicker movement, provided the piece has room to move. Pieces cannot shift through walls or other blocks.
